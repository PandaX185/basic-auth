# Basic Auth system 

Simple website of 3 screens (sign up, sign in and profile)

## Usage

To use the website just clone it and run `go build -o output` to get an executable.

Run the output file and open your localhost at port 5500.

The database is accessible from any IP (only for practice purposes), so you should be connected to it successfully.

Try to create a new account and then use it to sign in and Voila!
